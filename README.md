# Harmony

A Java wrapper . . . thing for the Discord API.

## Use

This wrapper is not done nor do I consider it close to being done. You can use it and do whatever with it but most of this bot/api/thing is not done or implemented yet.


## Login File

If you wish to use the tests a login.json file is needed. This is in JSON and is the same as the login request aka `{"email":"example@example.no", "password":"notapassword"}`
